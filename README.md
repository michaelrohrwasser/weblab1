Analysis:

The aim for my interactive map was to show where public art was displayed within the city of Vancouver, as well as overlaying the location of Vancouver's public art displays on top of all the public parks within the city of Vancouver to show potential correlations between public art displays and public parks. I believe that public spaces, such as parks can be important community hubs in any sort of urban space, especially in a big city like Vancouver. While green spaces like parks can be excellent spaces that communities can use, in highly developed urban areas, like in downtown city cores, having the necessary space to build green spaces and parks can be quite difficult, if not impossible. Hence why having public art installations in dense, urban areas can be another way to create a sense of community and give what can sometimes be dull, gray urban spaces a bit of personality, and provide local citizens and outsiders alike a place to congregate. A great example of this is within downtown Vancouver, as shown in my screenshot above, where public parks and green spaces are sparce and population density is quite high. There are plenty of public art installations within downtown Vancouver, and they certainly give the dense urban space a bit of personality and uniqueness.

The basemap I used for my map was a simple grey, monochrome background that shows street labels, places of interest, and neighbourhood labels. I chose to include these labels in my basemap, as they complimented my data quite well. The locations of each piece of art as well as the public parks were accessed via the City of Vancouver's open data source portal (https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/). Each public art installation is indicated by a red dot, with each dot having a very thin, black outline so that each piece of art can be identified individually, at any zoom level. Additionally, each piece of art is toggleable, with the art's name and location shown. I would have liked to have included each piece's brief description included in the toggleable window, however not every piece had a description, and with some of the ones that did, they were cut off as if there was a character limit, and I could no way of increasing the word or character limit of the art's description directly through the data source itself, therefore I decided to not include the descriptions of the individual pieces as I felt having incomplete descriptions for some of them would affect the overall quality of the map.
